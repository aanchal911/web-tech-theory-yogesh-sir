## 📌 Objective

The primary objective of this repository is to document and organize all web development activities conducted during the **classroom practical sessions**. Each file demonstrates practical implementation of core web technologies including:

* **HTML5** – Structure and layout
* **CSS3** – Styling and design
* **JavaScript** – Interactivity and behavior

This submission not only showcases **coding proficiency** but also reflects **active classroom engagement**, **real-time problem-solving**, and **progressive concept mastery** over the semester.

## 📚 HTML Programs

> **Directory:** `html programs/`

These programs introduced the basic building blocks of any webpage and were practiced during initial classroom lectures.

### 🔸 Files and Concepts:

* `attributes1.html` / `attributes2.html`
  → Understanding global attributes like `id`, `class`, `style`, and custom attributes.

* `hyperlink.html`
  → Demonstrates internal, external, and anchor links.

* `list1.html`
  → Covers ordered, unordered, and nested lists.

* `table1.html` / `table2.html` / `timetable.html`
  → Construction of tables using `<tr>`, `<td>`, `rowspan`, and `colspan`.

* `web.html`
  → A basic structured web page using headings, paragraphs, and formatting tags.

These programs built a **strong semantic foundation**, necessary for scalable web development.

---

## 🎨 CSS Programs

> **Directory:** `css programs/`
> Subdirectory: `time table templets/`

These files were part of the second phase of learning, focusing on **design, layout, and visual styling**.

### 🔸 Files and Topics:

* `css2.html`, `css3.html`, `css4.html`
  → Used internal and external CSS to style a table template, applying properties like:

  * Font family and size
  * Border collapse
  * Background colors
  * Alignment and spacing

* `tshirt.html`
  → Designed a product card (like a t-shirt) with styled content to simulate an e-commerce product preview layout.

These programs helped visualize how **content and design** work together, improving the UI/UX of a webpage.

---

## ⚙️ JavaScript Programs

> **Directory:** `js programs/`
> Subdirectories: `bulb/`, `frames/`, `gates/`, `password/`

These programs demonstrate **basic interactivity**, client-side scripting, and logic building using JavaScript.

### 🔸 Key Files and Their Purposes:

* `1.html`, `2.html`
  → Basic syntax practice and simple document manipulation.

* `calculation.html`
  → Arithmetic calculator that accepts input and performs operations dynamically.

* `email.html`
  → Validates email input fields using JavaScript.

* `password.html` + `password/` folder
  → Password field validation, toggling show/hide functionality using event listeners.

* `bulb/`
  → ON/OFF image toggling to simulate an electric bulb using DOM manipulation.

* `gates/`
  → Logical gates simulator using conditionals, representing AND, OR, NOT logic using checkboxes and JS.

* `frames/`
  → Practiced creating multi-frame HTML layouts with navigation.

These programs allowed real-time interaction with elements and showed how to **dynamically change content, styles, or behavior** using script logic.

## 📈 Learning Outcomes

Throughout the Web Development course, I have gained a **deep and practical understanding** of how modern websites are built from the ground up. This course has not only strengthened my **technical knowledge** but has also shaped my **creative thinking, design sense, and problem-solving ability**.

Here’s a summary of what I’ve learned:

* 🧱 **HTML**:
  Learned to structure webpages using semantic tags, forms, tables, multimedia, and hyperlinks. I now understand how to build clean, accessible, and SEO-friendly web layouts using proper markup techniques.

* 🎨 **CSS**:
  Mastered styling concepts, including selectors, colors, backgrounds, borders, spacing, positioning, and responsiveness. I also explored the use of different display models like **inline-block, flexbox, and grid** to make layouts visually appealing and adaptive.

* ⚙️ **JavaScript**:
  Developed the ability to make static websites dynamic using client-side scripting. I practiced:

  * DOM manipulation
  * Form validation
  * Event handling
  * Logical conditions
  * Real-time interaction with webpage elements (e.g., toggling bulb, simulating gates)

* 💻 **Web Page Integration**:
  I learned how to combine HTML, CSS, and JS efficiently to create interactive and engaging web experiences. This included understanding how the three technologies work together as the structure (HTML), style (CSS), and behavior (JavaScript) layers of a website.

* 🔀 **Debugging & Best Practices**:
  I’ve improved my code readability and maintainability through consistent practice, commenting, and error-fixing during lab sessions.

* 🌱 **Confidence & Creativity**:
  I feel more confident in developing full-fledged web pages and small applications from scratch. This course has sparked my interest in front-end development and UI/UX design.
